## Why Dual Licensing?

We believe that both the **ideas** (content) and the **implementation** (code) should be as free and accessible as possible:

- **CC0 for content**: Ensures that the educational resources, principles, and guidance around consent and Sexual Reliability Engineering can be freely adapted, translated, and shared without any restrictions.

- **MIT for code**: Provides clear legal protection for both contributors and users of the software while maintaining maximum freedom to use, modify, and distribute.

## Contributing

By contributing to this project, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same dual license structure. We encourage you to:

- **Fork freely** and create your own variations
- **Branch boldly** to experiment with new approaches
- **Contribute generously** to improve the commons
- **Adapt thoughtfully** for different communities and contexts

The only request we make is that you maintain a commitment to **Hippocratic harmlessness** in any derivative works.
