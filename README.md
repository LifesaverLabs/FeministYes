# Before You Say "Yes" - FeministYes

A <a href="https://www.lifesaverlabs.org">Lifesaver Labs Initiative</a>

## About This Project

**FeministY⁵es** is a thoughtful space for exploring conscious consent in new relationships. Applying principles from Sexual Reliability Engineering (SRE), this project treats intimacy with the same rigor that aviation, surgery, and critical infrastructure use for safety protocols.

The website provides:

- **Pre-Intimacy Checklist**: Essential safeguards including safewords, STD testing protocols, ground rules conversations, and birth control assessment
- **Safety Devices**: Digital tools like safeword apps, consent contracts, and relationship health check-ins
- **Conversation Starters**: Guidance for discussing boundaries, desires, and expectations
- **Éducational Resources**: Content inspired by Atul Gawande's *The Checklist Manifesto*, applying systems thinking to intimate relationships

**Core Philosophy**: Sexual and emotional intimacy is "high-voltage" human experience. Just as electricians follow protocols before working with live wires, we should establish safeguards before entering intimate spaces.
